## Description

[MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/develop/en/) is a set of libraries providing a high-level API to [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/).
It aims to be:
- Easy to use with a simple API supporting both synchronous (blocking) API calls and asynchronous API calls using callbacks.
- Fast and lightweight.
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android).
- Extensible (using compile-time plugins).
- Fully compliant with the MAVLink common standard/definitions.

In order to support multiple programming languages, MAVSDK implements a gRPC server in C++ which allows clients in different programming languages to connect to. The API is defined by the proto IDL ([proto files](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Proto/tree/master/protos)).
This architecture allows the clients to be implemented in idiomatic patterns, so using the tooling and syntax expected by end users. For example, the Python library can be installed from PyPi using `pip`.

The MAVSDK C++ part consists of:
- The [core library](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/develop/src/core) implementing the basic MAVLink communication.
- The [plugin libraries](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/develop/src/plugins) implementing the MAVLink communication specific to a feature.
- The [mavsdk_server](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/develop/src/mavsdk_server) implementing the gRPC server for the language clients.
